# Playwright E2E Testing Setup Summary

## âœ… What Was Added

### 1. Docker Service
- Added `playwright` service to `docker-compose.yml` with `testing` profile
- Service runs in background and accessible on port 9323 for UI mode
- Uses official Microsoft Playwright image with all browsers pre-installed

### 2. Test Structure
```
tests/e2e/
â”œâ”€â”€ tests/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ homepage.spec.js      # âœ… 3 tests - Homepage functionality 
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ patients.spec.js      # âœ… 6 tests - Patient list page functionality
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ navigation.spec.js    # âœ… 6 tests - Routing and navigation
â”œâ”€â”€ playwright.config.js      # Configuration for all browsers + mobile
â”œâ”€â”€ global-setup.js          # Pre-test setup and health checks
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json             # Dependencies and npm scripts
â””â”€â”€ Dockerfile              # Playwright container setup
```

### 3. Makefile Commands
- `make e2e-up` - Start all services including Playwright
- `make e2e-test` - Run all E2E tests
- `make e2e-ui` - Run tests with UI mode (great for debugging)
- `make e2e-report` - Show HTML test report
- `make e2e-down` - Stop all testing services
- `make test` - Run both backend smoke tests and E2E tests

## âœ… Test Coverage

### Homepage Tests
- Page loads successfully with correct title and content
- Layout structure (sidebar, main content) is present
- Responsive design works on mobile viewports

### Patients Page Tests  
- Page loads with correct table structure and headers
- Mock patient data displays correctly (John Doe, Jane Smith)
- Action buttons (Edit/Delete) are functional and clickable
- Button click handlers execute and log to console
- Pagination controls are present
- Mobile responsiveness

### Navigation Tests
- Direct URL navigation works for both pages
- Browser back/forward navigation functions

## âœ… Browser Coverage
- **Desktop**: Chromium, Firefox, WebKit (Safari)
- **Mobile**: Pixel 5 (Android), iPhone 12 (iOS)

## ðŸš€ Usage Examples

```bash
# Start everything and run tests
make e2e-test

# Debug tests with UI mode
make e2e-ui
# Then visit http://localhost:9323

# Run specific tests
docker-compose exec playwright npx playwright test tests/patients.spec.js

# Run tests in headed mode (see browser)
docker-compose exec playwright npm run test:headed

# View test report
make e2e-report
```

## ðŸ“Š Current Status
- **Total Tests**: 15 test cases across 5 browsers = 75 total test runs
- **Success Rate**: 100% (all tests passing after fixing CSS selectors)
- **Performance**: Full test suite completes in ~37 seconds
- **Features Tested**: âœ… Page loading, âœ… UI components, âœ… Navigation, âœ… Button interactions, âœ… Mobile responsive

## ðŸ”§ Integration with CI/CD
The setup is ready for CI/CD pipelines:
- Tests run in isolated Docker containers
- HTML reports and screenshots generated on failures
- JSON results for test reporting tools
- Configurable retry and parallelization settings
